									<p>Deep Learning, like many emerging approaches in Machine Learning, draws inspiration from nature, particularly the human brain. There are an estimated 10<sup>11</sup> neurons communicating via electrical signals in the brain, interacting through synapses that determine which neurons activate other neurons and the signal strength. Human decision-making and action-taking processes originate here, with responses resulting from many interactions in this network of neurons. Experiences 'train' the brain to activate certain neurons and send various signal strengths to determine optimal next steps, with high accuracy in every-day activities, and some level of uncertainty in entirely new situations. Neural networks are constructed based on this principle, and their premise is straightforward: emulate brain functions and harness computational power to exceed the brain's capabilities.</p>

									<h2>Why use Deep Learning?</h2>
									<p>Deep Learning models not only increase the number of parameters, often referred to as 'nodes' in DL, but also enhance the depth of the architectures that process this data. Rather than a model comprising a single layer of 10,000 nodes, consider a structure with a layer of 100 nodes passing to another layer of 100 nodes, where each pair between the two layers is interconnected. In both cases, the network essentially handles 10,000 different parameters. However, in the second example, a more intricate trend is assumed, contingent upon specific outcomes aligning to recognise a pattern.<p>
									<p>3Blue1Brown offers an insightful video on this topic, which I would highly recommend. They suggest that employing a Deep Learning architecture would benefit a model aiming to learn the underlying trend behind the MNIST Handwritten Digits dataset. In this situation, the objective is to correctly identify the handwritten digit in a 28x28 image as an integer 0-9.<p>
									<p>Consider how a Machine Learning algorithm might go about solving this problem. For instance, if we have a parameter that searches for a closed loop pattern on the digit, this might signify that the digit is a 0, 6, 8, or 9. Likewise, a parameter identifies whether there is a tail-end could indicate that the digit is a 1, ..., 7, or 9. Traditional Machine Learning models would treat the two as separate parameters, however, this means high weights might be assigned to some parameters for digits that are unlikely to be the true label. On the other hand, Deep Learning is theoretically able to capture dependencies in data. By incorporating a parameter that assigns a high value to digits with both a closed loop and a tail end, a more specific pattern is targeted, reducing the likelihood of overconfidence in incorrect classes.<p>
