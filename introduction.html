									<p>Deep Learning, like many emerging approaches in Machine Learning, draws inspiration from nature, particularly the human brain. There are an estimated 10<sup>11</sup> neurons communicating via electrical signals in the brain, interacting through synapses that determine which neurons activate other neurons, and the signal strength. Human decision-making and action-taking processes originate here, with responses resulting from many interactions in this network of neurons. Experiences 'train' the brain to activate certain neurons and send various signal strengths to determine optimal next steps, with high accuracy in every-day activities, and some level of uncertainty in relatively new situations. Neural networks are constructed based on this principle, and their premise is straightforward: emulate brain functions and harness computational power to exceed the brain's capabilities.</p>

									<h2>Why use Deep Learning?</h2>
									<p>Deep Learning models are characterised by the depth of their architectures. For instance, consider a simple Machine Learning model consisting of 16 input features. In the context of Deep Learning, these features can be conceptualised as nodes. This could be visualised as a shallow network with just one layer, where each of the 16 nodes connects to each of the 10 output classes. In this scenario, the weight of each connection represents the strength of the signal corresponding to a particular output class, resulting in a total of 16 x 10 = 160 model parameters. Now, contrast this with an architecture featuring 8 input features, passing to a layer of 8 nodes, then to the classifying layer. This results in a total of (8 x 8) + (8 x 10) = 144 model parameters. Despite both examples yielding a similar number of model parameters, the latter assumes a more intricate trend, relying on specific dependencies between outcomes to recognise patterns.<p>
									<p>An illustrative example demonstrating the utility of Deep Learning principles would be tackling the MNIST Handwritten Digits dataset. In this task, the objective is to correctly identify the handwritten digit in a 28x28 pixel image as an integer 0-9.<p>
									<p>Consider how a Machine Learning algorithm might go about solving this problem. For instance, if we have a parameter that searches for a closed loop pattern on the digit, this might signify that the digit is a 0, 6, 8, or 9. Likewise, a parameter that indicates whether there is a tail-end on the digit could indicate that the digit is a 1, ..., 7, or 9. Traditional Machine Learning models would treat the two as separate parameters, however, this means high weights might be assigned to some parameters on digits that are unlikely to be the true label. On the other hand, Deep Learning is theoretically able to capture dependencies in data. By incorporating a parameter that assigns a high value to digits with both a closed loop and a tail end, a more specific pattern is targeted, reducing the likelihood of overconfidence in incorrect classes.<p>
									<p>In practice, Deep Learning algorithms often do not capture dependencies that are easy for humans to understand. Even so, they perform very well on these kinds of tasks. As with all tasks in Machine Learning, there is a fine line to tread between producing high-performing models and producing models that are well-interpretable and enable actionable response.</p>
